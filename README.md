### Rules for playing the game 🎮
<pre>
🔹 Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color buttons, in order.

🔹 Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

🔹 Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly.

🔹 If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.

🔹 Try beating my High Score of <b>21</b>
